<img src="https://wiki.beamng.com/images/d/d0/BeamNG.drive-logo-2016.svg">

## Overview

This mod transforms the Lansdale's engine and transmission in BeamNG.Drive into a realistic representation of the Chrysler Grand Voyager (2008-2016) with its 2.8L CRD diesel engine (with the Garrett GT1544V) and 6-speed automatic transmission (62TE). It includes a custom engine, transmission and turbo to match the real vehicleâ€™s performance, achieving a 0-62 mph time of approximately 12.4 seconds (with +100KG), closely aligned with the real car's 12.8 seconds.
